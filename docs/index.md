# dinkus


> In typography, a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks in a horizontal row, i.e.   ∗ ∗ ∗  . The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.

# undercovered

<u>Adjective</u>

*(Of an individual, project, social dynamic, single event, etc.)*

**Less present in popular discourse than is contextually appropriate.**

When I use the term "undercovered," I am describing something which "mainstream media" (*technology journalism*, most often) has not, is not, and/or is not likely to adequately amplify according to my own framework of relevance.

#### Some prime examples:

* [**Bandcamp as the answer to all contemporary woes regarding music streaming services**](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music).
* [Mastodon as the answer to (a great many) contemporary woes regarding social networks](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview).
* [Discord as a superior (and free!) Slack alternative for small businesses/projects](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison).

## dinkus


> In typography, a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks in a horizontal row, i.e.   ∗ ∗ ∗  . The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.

## undercovered

<u>Adjective</u>

*(Of an individual, project, social dynamic, single event, etc.)*

**Less present in popular discourse than is contextually appropriate.**

When I use the term "undercovered," I am describing something which "mainstream media" (*technology journalism*, most often) has not, is not, and/or is not likely to adequately amplify according to my own framework of relevance.

##### Some prime examples:

* [**Bandcamp as the answer to all contemporary woes regarding music streaming services**](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music).
* [Mastodon as the answer to (a great many) contemporary woes regarding social networks](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview).
* [Discord as a superior (and free!) Slack alternative for small businesses/projects](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison).
