In Christianity, an anchorite or anchoret (female: anchoress) is someone who, for religious reasons, withdraws from secular society so as to be able to lead an intensely prayer-oriented, ascetic, or Eucharist-focused life. Whilst anchorites are frequently considered to be a type of religious hermit, unlike hermits they were required to take a vow of stability of place, opting for permanent enclosure in cells often attached to churches. Also unlike hermits, anchorites were subject to a religious rite of consecration that closely resembled the funeral rite, following which they would be considered dead to the world, a type of living saint. Anchorites had a certain autonomy, as they did not answer to any ecclesiastical authority other than the bishop.The anchoritic life is one of the earliest forms of Christian monasticism. In the Catholic Church today, it is one of the "Other Forms of Consecrated Life" and governed by the same norms as the consecrated eremitic life. In medieval England, the earliest recorded anchorites existed in the 11th century. Their highest number—around 200 anchorites—were recorded in the 13th century.From the 12th to the 16th centuries, female anchorites consistently outnumbered their male counterparts, sometimes by as many as four to one (in the 13th century), dropping eventually to two to one (in the 15th century). The sex of a high number of anchorites, however, is not recorded for these periods.Between 1536 and 1539, the dissolution of the monasteries ordered by Henry VIII of England effectively brought the anchorite tradition to an end.

# cavalcade


## Noun

1. a procession of people traveling on horseback
	- Less specific
		- procession

*From LookUp*:
Noun
1.	a formal procession of people walking, on horseback, or riding in vehicles
the royal cavalcade proceeded through the city

## Origin

late 16th century (denoting a ride or raid on horseback): from French, from Italian cavalcata, from cavalcare ‘to ride’, based on Latin caballus ‘horse’

## Wikipedia

A cavalcade is a procession or parade on horseback, or a mass trail ride by a company of riders.  The focus of a cavalcade is participation rather than display. Often, the participants do not wear costumes or ride in formation. Often, a cavalcade re-enacts an important historical event and follows a long-distance trail.  A cavalcade may also be a pilgrimage.
Many cavalcades involve ceremonial entries into and departures from towns and villages along the way.  A small version of such a ceremonial entry is the "grand entry" that is traditional in many rodeos.  Long-distance cavalcades may acquire more riders who join from populated places along its route.

The term cavalcade comes from the classical Latin word caballus, used to describe a strong work horse.  This developed into the word caballicare, "to ride horseback," which in Italian became cavalcare. In Spanish the term for cavalcade is cabalgata.

Chaff (; also UK: ) is the dry, scaly protective casing of the seeds of cereal grains or similar fine, dry, scaly plant material (such as scaly parts of flowers or finely chopped straw).

A cognomen was the third name of a citizen of ancient Rome, under Roman naming conventions. Initially, it was a nickname, but lost that purpose when it became hereditary.

Cosmopolitanism is the idea that all human beings are members of a single community. Its adherents are known as cosmopolitan or cosmopolite. Cosmopolitanism is both prescriptive and aspirational, believing humans can and should be "world citizens" in a "universal community". The idea encompasses different dimensions and avenues of community, such as promoting universal moral standards, establishing global political structures, or developing a platform for mutual cultural expression and tolerance.For example, Kwame Anthony Appiah articulates a cosmopolitan community where individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.). By comparison, Immanuel Kant envisioned a cosmopolitan world where armies were abolished and humans were governed under a representative global institution. In all instances, proponents of cosmopolitanism share an emphasis that all humans should form one cohesive and united community.

In a looser but related sense, "cosmopolitan" is also used to describe places where people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious backgrounds live together and interact with each other.

The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.

> A doof or bush doof is a type of outdoor dance party generally held in a remote country area, or outside a large city in surrounding bush or rainforest. Originating in the post-punk electronic music scene of Melbourne, Australia in the early 1990s, events referred to as doofs are now held worldwide and have built from a small set of social groups to a subculture with millions of active members worldwide, considered by some as a full blown culture similar to raves or teknivals. Doofs generally have healing workshops, speakers, art, live artists and DJs playing a range of electronic music, commonly goa, house, dub techno, Techno, acid heavy sounds and psychedelic trance.

# eschatology

	- Less specific

		- divinity
	- Related
		- eschatological
		- eschatologist

*From Wikipedia*
Eschatology concerns expectations of the end of the present age, human history, or of the world itself. The end of the world or end times is predicted by several world religions, which teach that negative world events will reach a climax. Belief that the end of the world is imminent is known as apocalypticism, and over time has been held both by members of mainstream religions and by doomsday cults. In the context of mysticism, the term refers metaphorically to the end of ordinary reality and to reunion with the divine. Various religions treat eschatology as a future event prophesied in sacred texts or in folklore.

The Abrahamic religions maintain a linear cosmology, with end-time scenarios containing themes of transformation and redemption. In later Judaism, the term "end of days" makes reference to the Messianic Age and includes an in-gathering of the exiled Jewish diaspora, the coming of the Messiah, the resurrection of the righteous, and the world to come. Some forms of Christianity depict the end time as a period of tribulation that precedes the second coming of Christ, who will face the rise of the Antichrist along with his power structure and false prophets, and usher in the Kingdom of God. In Islam, the Day of Judgment is preceded by the appearance of the Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl, and followed by the descending of ʿĪsā (Jesus), which shall triumph over the false Messiah or Antichrist; his defeat will lead to a sequence of events that will end with the sun rising from the west and the beginning of the Qiyāmah (Judgment Day).

Dharmic religions tend to have more cyclical worldviews, with end-time eschatologies characterized by decay, redemption, and rebirth (though some believe transitions between cycles are relatively uneventful). In Hinduism, the end time occurs when Kalki, the final incarnation of Vishnu, descends atop a white horse and brings an end to the current Kali Yuga, completing a cycle that starts again with the regeneration of the world. In Buddhism, the Buddha predicted his teachings would be forgotten after 5,000 years, followed by turmoil. It says a bodhisattva named Maitreya will appear and rediscover the teachings of the Buddha Dharma, and that the ultimate destruction of the world will then come through seven suns.

Since the development of the concept of deep time in the 18th century and the calculation of the estimated age of planet Earth, scientific discourse about end times has considered the ultimate fate of the universe. Theories have included the Big Rip, Big Crunch, Big Bounce, and Big Freeze (heat death). Social and scientific commentators also worry about global catastrophic risks and scenarios that could result in human extinction.

- *Acrylic* - (aka Resin) - A common material used for making fountain pens due to durability, light weight, and ink/water resistance and resistance of staining. It's basically plastic.
- *Aerometric* - A type of filling mechanism that uses a bladder (or sac) inside a metal cartridge; you fill by squeezing the sac. More common in vintage pens.
- *Air Channels* - The slits cut in the feed that allow air to help draw ink through the feed.
- *Archival* - Fountain pen ink that is fade resistant, retaining much of its original look.
- *Baby's Bottom* - When the tip of a nib is too rounded where the two tines meet, preventing the capillary action needed for the ink to draw down to the paper. Though very smooth writing, nibs with this symptom will typically have skipping problems.
- *Balance* - Refers to how evenly distributed the weight of the pen feels from the front and back in the hand, and it varies based on the person holding it. It can either feel evenly balanced, front (nib) heavy, or back (top) heavy.
- *Ballpoint* - What you're probably used to, a pen with a grease or paste ink that is used by rolling the tip (with a ball) across the paper, which rotates the ball and pulls ink from the pen. These came about around the 1950's and were the disruptive technology to the fountain pen that started their decline. Though a necessary tool, they provide a less-than-ideal writing experience due to their limited ink color options, erratic flow, and high amount of pressure required to write (relative to a fountain pen).
- *Band* - (Centerband) - The metal decorative ring that is usually placed near the bottom of the pen cap for decorative purposes, or perhaps to provide reinforcement to the cap threads.
- *Barrel* - The long part of the main body of the pen which houses the ink reservoir.
- *Biocide* - Chemicals used in fountain pen ink to prevent mold and other biological growths from, well, growing.
- *Bladder* - (Sac) - The rubbery sac that houses ink in various pen filling mechanisms, such as the aerometric.
- *Bleeding* - or *Bleedthrough* - A symptom of ink soaking through the paper so much that it crosses over to the other side of the page. This can vary based on the ink or the paper but is usually a symptom of paper that is too absorbent. It is more extreme than show-through or ghosting.
- *Blind Cap* - A removable cap that covers a pen's filling mechanism.
- *Blotter* - Usually made of wood or metal, this holds blotting paper that is used to soak up excess ink on a page to decrease drying time.
- *Blotting Paper* - Special super-absorbent paper (like J. Herbin's) that is used to soak up extra ink on the page without smearing it, to decrease dry time when needed.
- *Body* - The main part of the pen (the part without the cap), usually also called the barrel.
- *Blue-Black* - A common designation for a dark blue ink, though there really isn't any strict way to declare a blue-black apart from an ink that is just dark blue, navy, or midnight. The original term comes from iron gall or similar inks where the ink begins as a blue color, and over time fades into a dull black color.
- *Brassing* - When a plating wears off, exposing the underlying metal (usually brass).
- *Breather Hole* - A hole in the nib, at the end of the nib slit, that allows air to assist in the ink flow, also called a vent hole.
- *Breather Tube* - A small tube that is used to assist in filling certain types of pens, such as the Noodler's Ahab Flex Pen.
- *Bulb Filler* - A simple type of filling mechanism that uses a small rubber sac at the end of a large reservoir, and fills by squeezing the sac.
- *Bulb Syringe* - A handy tool used to either suction boogies from your baby's nose or to help flush out cartridge/converter fountain pens while cleaning
- *Bulletproof* - A Noodler's term used to describe ink that is particularly fraud resistant and can withstand water, UV rays, bleach, oven cleaners, etc.
- *Burping* - A symptom (particularly with eyedropper filled pens) where ink comes out in a large drip or blob out of the grip section of the pen. This is usually caused by a variance in pressure between the inside of the pen and the surrounding environment, such as on an airplane with changing pressure or with a pen that has a large reservoir that is low on ink (mostly air) where the heat from your hand while writing can increase the pressure in the pen.
- *Button Filler* - A filling mechanism that works by pushing a button, more common in vintage pens.
- *CA (cyanoacrylate)* - Superglue, basically.
- *Calligraphy* - Fancy writing, often done with dip pens but can be emulated with italic nibs.
- *Calligraphy Pens* - A term almost always used to describe italic nib fountain pens, usually in the lower price range and sold in sets to lure writers in who want to make their handwriting appear like calligraphy. True calligraphy pens are typically dip pens, which do not use a feed like fountain pens.
- *Cap* - The part of a pen that covers the nib and attaches to the pen body.
- *Capillary Action* - The ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the external forces like gravity. This is the basis for how a fountain pen works.
- *Cartridge* - A small, sealed plastic reservoir that holds fountain pen ink. Many pen brands use their own proprietary style, but there is one common style called Standard International, where many pen makers use the same type of cartridge. The benefit of cartridges is the convenience, however, they are not nearly as economical as bottled pen ink and the color range is usually incredibly limited
- *Cartridge/Converter (C/C)* - A small filling mechanism (usually a screw-piston type) that fits onto a pen that also accepts a cartridge. This allows you to use any brand's bottled ink instead of relying on limited proprietary ink cartridges.
- *Clip* - The metal doohickey usually attached to the cap that holds your pen in your shirt pocket and also keeps it from rolling off your desk and landing nib first on the ground (why does it ALWAYS fall nib down??).
- *Conversion* - When you are altering a pen in some way to provide an alternate filling method. The most common practice is using a 'cartridge converter' to use bottled ink in a pen in place of ink cartridges, or in filling the whole body of a pen with ink (this is the eyedropper method).
- *Converter* - A cartridge-shaped reservoir that allows you to use bottled pen ink when a cartridge would otherwise be your only option. Pens that have this option are usually referred to as cartridge/converter or C/C.
- *Corrosion* - When the metal parts of your pen either rust or chemically disintegrate due to chemical exposure or oxidation.
- *Crack* - When your pen material (usually plastic) splits apart. This is usually caused by stress in some way, either due to extreme force (like dropping your pen on a hard surface) or over-tightening of certain parts.
- *Crisp* - (Italic) - A nib ground so that the tip is flat, with very sharp edges to give a very distinct line variation from cross-stroke to downstroke. These nibs require you to write slowly and hold the pen at a very specific angle, otherwise, the sharp edges of the nib will tear the paper.
- *Cursive* - (Italic) - A nib ground so that the tip is flat, but with slightly more rounded edges. This sacrifices a bit of line variation, for the benefit of a smoother and more forgiving writing experience than a crisp italic. This nib is sometimes called a 'stub', though a stub is typically even more rounded than the cursive italic.
- *Demonstrator* - Transparent pens, originally developed for salesmen to show to distributors and retailers to display the inner workings of the pens' parts. Now, it is a common aesthetic design adopted across many brands. The appeal is that you can see the ink level clearly in your pen without having to take it apart.
- *Dip Pen* - A writing instrument that doesn't have an internal ink reservoir, it instead must have its nib immersed in ink every few words to keep it writing. Dip pens typically use ink that is thicker (usually shellac-based) than fountain pen ink.
- *Dip Test* - When you want to get an idea of how a particular color of ink will look in your fountain pen, but you don't want to draw ink all the way up into it (thus meaning you have to do a full cleaning), you instead just immerse the nib into the ink and write with it without ever drawing ink into the pen.
- *Drawing Ink* - (India Ink) - Ink that is composed of a fine soot that is combined with water and a binding agent such as shellac. This ink is more durable and permanent than fountain pen ink, but should only be reserved for use with dip pens.
- *Dry* - When ink does not flow very freely or heavily out of a pen. This can be either a characteristic of a pen or an ink, but both are referring to the same end result of a limited amount of ink coming out of the pen.
- *Ebonite* - A hard rubber material commonly used in vintage (and some modern) pens.
- *Eternal* - A term coined by Noodler's Ink to describe the properties of a fountain pen ink that is resistant to UV exposure and fading over a long period of time.
- *Eyedropper* - Not specific to any brand, a type of filling method where the entire body of the pen is used as a reservoir for the ink.
- *Eyedropper Conversion* - The process of modifying a fountain pen that has an existing filling mechanism (such as cartridge/converter, piston, or aerometric) so that the entire body of the pen can be used as an ink reservoir.
- *Feathering* - A term used to describe when fountain pen ink soaks into absorbent paper, resulting in a veiny pattern that branches out from the line drawn. It can also be referred to as 'spread'.
- *Feed* - The piece of plastic or ebonite (usually black) that hugs the back of the nib and acts as a vehicle for ink delivery from the reservoir to the nib.
- *Feedback* - The amount of 'bite' or resistance perceived during a writing experience. This is a consequence of the relationship between the smoothness of a fountain pen nib and the smoothness of the paper being used. Also commonly referred to as 'tooth'.
- *Feed Channel* - A very thin slit in the feed that hugs against the back of the nib and provides a route for the ink to travel through the feed. This is what helps to provide the necessary capillary action required for ink flow.
- *Ferrogallic* - (Iron Gall) Ink - Ink made from iron salts and tannic acids. Though quite permanent and waterproof, these inks are typically known for causing chemical corrosion to metal pen parts (especially the nib) and should be used sparingly or with less-valuable pens. Modern iron gall formulations are not as harmful as the inks of the past, but extra precaution such as not leaving the ink in a pen for more than a week is strongly recommended.
- *Filigree* - a decorative (usually precious) metal overlay with openings that show the material of the pen under it.
- *Flex* - The ability of the tines of a fountain pen nib to spread under varying writing pressure, resulting in variation of the width of the line drawn. It's super cool.
- *Flooding* - Forcing ink down through the feed by intentionally pushing it out of the reservoir.
- *Flow* - The movement of ink through the pen. Often described as 'wet' or 'dry', depending on how freely the ink is willing to come out of the pen.
- *Fluorescing* - When ink glows under blacklight.
- *Freeze Resistant* - Ink that is formulated to resist freezing at extremely low temperatures.
- *French-Ruled Paper* - (Séyès) - Standard 'school' paper in France, it is an 8mm x 8mm grid that is separated by 2mm horizontal lines to give guidance and structure to cursive writing.
- *Gel Pen* - A disposable cartridge-type pen that has a gel-based ink inside it (such as Pilot G2).
- *Ghosting* - When you can see what's written on the other side of a sheet of paper without the ink coming through the page. This isn't to be confused with bleed through, where the ink actually soaks through to the other side. This is also known as show-through or echo.
- *Glass Pen* - A writing instrument that must be dipped in ink and provides ink delivery the paper through a series of twisted flutes on the tip....and it's glass, duh.
- *Gold* - You know what this is. Typically used for nibs on more expensive pens or as plating for decoration on fountain pen hardware.
- *GSM* - (aka 'g' or gm^2) grams per square meter, a measurement of a paper's weight. Though this designation is commonly used to refer to a paper's thickness, not all papers with the same GSM may be the same thickness, because there are other factors involved such as the material of the paper and the sizing used that influence how heavy it is. Generally speaking though, it is best to use papers that are 80g weight or higher for good performance with fountain pens (though there are of course always exceptions).
- *Grip section* - The part of the pen you hold where the nib fits in, sometimes called just a 'section'.
- *Halo* - An ink property where there is an intentional separation of dye components to give a highlighting effect.
- *Hardware* - The metal ornamentation on a pen, usually referring to the clip, finial, and center band. Also called 'trim'.
- *Highlighter* - Fountain pen inks that are designed to be used to highlight on top of written or printed ink.
- *Hood(ed) Nib* - A covering that goes over the top of a nib to make it less likely that you will touch it and get ink on your fingers. Made famous by the Parker 51.
- *India Ink* - Ink that is composed of a fine soot that is combined with water and a binding agent such as shellac. This ink is more durable and permanent than fountain pen ink, but should only be reserved for use with dip pens.
- *Ink* - The liquid substance that you put in a fountain pen to be able to use it for more than a paperweight or a piece of jewelry.
- *Ink Syringe* - A hypodermic needle (ideally blunt-tip) that is used to refill ink cartridges or decant the last bit of ink from a bottle.
- *Ink Window* - a translucent section of a pen that allows you to see when your ink level is getting low.
- *Inkwell* - A storage container used for housing liquid ink, usually made of glass.
- *Insert* - A cone-shaped reservoir that seats inside a bottle of ink to help you fill a fountain pen when the ink level gets low.
- *Invisible* - Fountain pen ink that is clear and is nearly invisible on paper to the naked eye when written with. These inks can be viewed later using other means, like specific lighting conditions.
- *Iridium* - A very hard-wearing metal (usually some kind of alloy) used for tipping material on fountain pen nibs.
- *Iridium Point Germany (IPG)* - A designation displayed on some manufacturer's nibs. Iridium refers to the hard-wearing metal used to create the ball on the tip of the nib, and the German aspect could mean a variety of things. It doesn't necessarily mean the nib was made in Germany, but just that (at least) the tipping material used for the point comes from Germany. This is quite confusing and does create some mystery about where some nibs actually come from. Brian Gray of the Edison Pen Company has a great article on the [IPG Nib designation](http://edisonpen.com/ipgnibs2).
- *Iron Gall* - Ink made from iron salts and tannic acids. Though quite permanent and waterproof, these inks are typically known for causing chemical corrosion to metal pen parts (especially the nib) and should be used sparingly or with less-valuable pens. Modern iron gall formulations are not as harmful as the inks of the past, but extra precaution such as not leaving the ink in a pen for more than a week is strongly recommended.
- *Italic* - (Nib) - A type of grind where the tip of the nib is flattened so that there is a distinct line variation while you write when you change from the cross-stroke to the down-stroke.
- *Lacquer* - Clear or colored varnish that's used to provide protection and durability to a pen's surface.
- *Limited Edition (LE)* - Pens that are designed to be made in only limited numbers. They are often engraved with a designation with which number pen it is.
- *Lubricated* - Ink that has special additives to make it flow better in your pen, and keep the internal components operating smoothly. Noodler's American Eel series of inks are most known for this property.
- *Maki-e* - Japanese lacquer sprinkled with precious metal powder as a decoration. There are several different methods of this technique, but all of them are extremely cool, very hard to do, and take forever to do, which makes pens with maki-e very expensive.
- *Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK)* - Also known as butanone, this is used as a chemical welding agent to affix pen parts together.
- *Mixable *\- Fountain pen inks that are designed to be mixed together to create new colors without adverse reactions between inks.
- *Mold* - Spore growth in ink, commonly called SITB (Stuff In The Bottle). Mold is a 'four-letter-word' in the fountain pen ink world, and generally very frowned upon. It can either come up as white fuzzy stuff on the surface of the ink where you can see it as soon as you open a bottle or as sludge down inside the ink that is much harder to find until you suck it up into your pen. Though mold is quite scary, it seldom actually causes any long-term damage to a pen. Most ink companies put biocides in their inks to prevent the growth of mold, so it is rare that it occurs.
- *Music Nib* - A type of stub/italic nib that is designed for increased ink flow. Platinum and Sailor both have nibs they call Music Nibs, and they are really little more than regular stub nibs. Traditionally these nibs have three tines (two slits).
- *Nail* - Nibs that have no flexibility at all, that write as stiff as a....nail.
- *Newbie (Noob)* - Someone brand new to the world of fountain pens.
- *Nib* - The metal tip of a fountain pen that actually touches the paper.
- *Nib Creep* - When ink comes up through the nib tines and covers part of the top of the nib. It can be a symptom of the ink or pen, but is purely aesthetic and doesn't typically have any effect on the function of a pen.
- *NID* - New Ink Day, when your new ink shipment arrives.
- *NPD* - New Pen Day, when your new fountain pen arrives.
- *Oblique* - A nib grind that is like an italic, but slanted to one side (either left or right). This grind is quite rare these days and is hard to find unless you have it custom ground.
- *O-Ring* - A rubber ring that helps to seal internal components of a pen from leaking ink.
- *Overwriter* - Someone who writes with their hand on the page so that it sits above where the nib is writing. This term is most commonly used to describe left-handed writers, as it creates a special problem due to the fact that the hand would be rubbing directly over what's being written.
- *Palladium* - A durable silvery-white precious metal in the platinum family used by some pen manufacturers in their pens.
- *Permanent* - Traditionally, a fountain pen ink that is water resistant and fade resistant. In more rare cases, permanent ink can even be acid proof, UV resistant, forgery-resistant and more.
- *Pigmented* - Fountain pen ink that is made up of finely-ground solid particles in liquid suspension, like paint. Some brands make specially-formulated pigmented ink for use in fountain pens, where the solid matter is microscopically ground to the point where it can flow through feeds.
- *Piston* - A type of mechanism that uses a retracting plunger inside a sealed tube in fountain pens and converters to draw ink into a pen. They can either be screw or push operated, though screw pistons are the most common.
- *Piston Filler* - A fountain pen that has a piston filling mechanism built into the body of it, so that the body of the pen acts as the ink reservoir.
- *Plating* - When a coating of one metal goes overtop of another, usually to provide added wear protection and aesthetic appeal.
- *Plunger* - The rod inside a piston that moves up and down to draw ink in and out of a pen (or converter).
- *Posting* - When you put the cap of a pen onto the back end of the body (the part you hold).
- *Precious Resin* - A marketing term, most famously used by Mont Blanc, that essentially means plastic.
- *Prime* - When you soak a pen feed with ink to get it started. This happens as a consequence of filling a pen through its nib when filling from a bottle of ink, but you can also prime a pen by forcing ink down through the feed by reversing the filling mechanism from the way you filled it.
- *Proprietary* - Refers to components that are designed and made to fit specifically one brand, as opposed to being universal. Examples would include LAMY nibs fitting only on LAMY pens, or Pilot ink cartridges fitting only on Pilot pens.
- *Railroading* - When the flow of ink is broken and the result is that the tines of the nib draw two separate, parallel lines on the page. This is most common using flexible nib pens.
- *Reservoir* - A cavity inside a pen that holds ink.
- *Resin* - Plastic.
- *Retractable Nib* - A pen that is designed without a cap, so that the nib itself draws into the pen body when closed. The most popular pens that do this are the Pilot Vanishing Point and Lamy Dialog 3. This is a common feature of ballpoint (click) pens, but not common in fountain pens.
- *Rhodium* - An extremely durable (and expensive) silver-colored metal most often used for plating over stainless steel to provide added durability to pen hardware and nibs.
- *Rocking Blotter* - A tool (usually wood) that hold sheets of specially absorbent blotting paper that is used to soak up excess ink left on paper.
- *Rollerball* - A pen that contains a gel ink that is housed inside a replaceable cartridge.
- *Sac* - a rubbery reservoir that houses ink. Common in many vintage pens, they're used much less often today.
- *Saturation* - An ink term used to describe the perceived intensity of a specific color. Ink users often refer to the level of saturation of an ink by how much dye is perceived to be present in the ink. Generally speaking, the higher saturated inks have bolder colors but extended drying times on paper.
- *Scented* - Fountain pen ink that is formulated to have a specific smell, generally corresponding with the ink name.
- *Scratchy* - When a nib provides resistance when being moved across the paper, often caused by misaligned nib tines.
- *Screw Cap* - A pen cap that is removed/replaced by interlocking threads on the cap and pen body that mate together with a twisting motion.
- *Section* - The part of the pen you hold where the nib fits in, often called a 'grip section'.
- *Semi-Flex* - When a nib bends slightly under pressure to give a soft feel when writing, not to the extreme of flex nibs where the nib tines actually separate to provide line variation.
- *Séyès (French-Ruled) Paper* - Standard 'school' paper in France, it is an 8mm x 8mm grid that is separated by 2mm horizontal lines to give guidance and structure to cursive writing.
- *Shading* - A common (and often desired) result of a fountain pen ink pooling in certain parts of a letter when writing, so that the color and saturation of the ink appears different within a single letter or word. This characteristic cannot be achieved with ballpoint or rollerball pens and is a very appealing aspect of fountain pen use for those particularly drawn to all the pretty ink colors.
- *Sheen* - Characteristic of a fountain pen ink where when ink pools another color can be seen on top of the ink, especially when looked at in different light angles using certain paper types.
- *Shimmering* - Fountain pen ink that has small particles of glitter mixed in.
- *Show-Through* - When you can see what's written on the other side of a sheet of paper without the ink coming through the page. This isn't to be confused with bleed through, where the ink actually soaks through to the other side. This is also known as ghosting or echo.
- *Silicone Grease* - A clear, inert grease that is used to lubricate moving parts of fountain pens, as well as seal up threads for eyedropper conversions. The appeal of this grease is that it doesn't harden over time, it is water/ink-resistant, and it will not react with fountain pen inks.
- *SITB* - "Stuff In The Bottle", a term used to describe mold, sludge, chemical sedimentation, or some other 'strange' foreign substance present in a bottle of pen ink.
- *Sizing *\- A coating for paper that affects its ability to absorb liquids (like ink). Heavily sized papers are typically more ideal for fountain pens because they are smoother and more ink repellant.
- *Skipping* - When ink doesn't flow consistently from a pen, causing the ink to start and stop flowing as you write. This could be caused by the pen, paper, ink, or any combination of the three.
- *Slit* - The very thin cut running from the tip of the nib up to the breather hole that carries the ink from the feed to the tip of the nib.
- *Snap Cap* - A pen cap that is removed/replaced by pulling/pushing onto the pen body, usually resulting in a clicking sound.
- *Soft* - A term used to describe a nib that is springy and somewhat flexible.
- *Special Edition (SE)* - Similar to a limited edition, but typically without individual serial numbers. A product produced for a limited period of time.
- *Stainless Steel* - A very common alloy used in the making of fountain pen parts, particularly nibs.
- *Standard International* - The most commonly accepted size of fountain pen ink cartridges and converters that many manufacturers use. Many pen companies use all proprietary parts for their pens, but the only real 'common' standard for ink cartridge and converters that crosses into multiple brands is the Standard International. There are both short cartridges (most common) and long cartridges that are considered Standard International size.
- *Stub* - A nib that is ground so that the tip is slightly wider than it is tall, resulting in a variation in line width when switching between writing on the cross-stroke and down-stroke. This is similar to an italic nib, but with more rounded edges to make writing smoother and more enjoyable for everyday use.
- *Syringe* - A tool used to refill ink cartridges, get last bits of ink out of a bottle, clean pen parts, and fill certain pens such as eyedropper pens.
- *Taper* - When the diameter of a pen part gradually gets smaller.
- *Threads* - Thin grooves cut into a pen to hold parts together, especially pen caps to the pen body.
- *Tip* - The small ball part on the end of a fountain pen nib that actually touches the paper when writing.
- *Tipping Material* - A small bit of hard-wearing metal (usually some sort of iridium alloy) that is welded to the end of a nib and ground to a specific intended size.
- *Tooth* - The amount of 'bite' or resistance perceived during a writing experience. This is a consequence of the relationship between the smoothness of a fountain pen nib and the smoothness of the paper being used. Also commonly referred to as 'feedback'.
- *Translucent* - When a pen material is not entirely opaque, and you can see light coming through it. This comes in handy with fountain pens when you want to be able to see your ink level at a glance.
- *Trim* - The metal ornamentation on a pen, usually referring to the clip, finial, and center band. Also called 'hardware'.
- *Two-Tone* - When two different metals are used next to each other, often on a fountain pen nib. Often it is yellow gold and rhodium.
- *Urushi* - An extremely durable and beautiful Japanese lacquer derived from Urushi trees. The urushi lacquer process is very skill and time intensive, and quite hazardous when wet since it contains urushiol, the active ingredient in poison ivy. When cured, it creates an incredibly hard and durable finish for pens and can be polished to a very high sheen.
- *UV* - Ultra-violet, radiation that affects ink colors in particular to cause fading.
- *Vacuum-Fill* - A design of pen that uses a combination of pressure and vacuum to create suction to fill a fountain pen with ink.
- *Vegetal* - A type of resin that's used for making fountain pens, most notably Noodler's brand. It has a very distinct smell when manufactured, though it does weaken over time. It is also fully biodegradable when buried underground.
- *Vent Hole* - A hole in the nib, at the end of the nib slit, that allows air to assist in the ink flow, also called a breather hole.
- *Water Resistance* - Very rarely is an ink ever "waterproof" and is completely unaffected by water. More often than not, water resistant inks are just that: resistant in some ways to the fading effects brought on by exposure to water. Water resistance means that a portion of the ink will remain after being subjected to water. This might only be one ingredient of the ink, leaving behind a legible remnant with little or no representation of the original color.
- *Wet* - When ink flows very freely and heavily out of a pen. This can be either a characteristic of a pen or an ink, but both are referring to the same end result of a generous amount of ink coming out of the pen.
- *Wet Noodle* - A flexible nib pen that is incredibly flexible with even the slightest of pressure. These pens were more common around the turn of the 20th century, and are now coveted in the vintage pen market and sold at an absolute premium.

- *Acrylic* - (aka Resin) - A common material used for making fountain pens due to durability, light weight, and ink/water resistance and resistance of staining. It's basically plastic.
- *Aerometric* - A type of filling mechanism that uses a bladder (or sac) inside a metal cartridge; you fill by squeezing the sac. More common in vintage pens.
- *Air Channels* - The slits cut in the feed that allow air to help draw ink through the feed.
- *Archival* - Fountain pen ink that is fade resistant, retaining much of its original look.
- *Baby's Bottom* - When the tip of a nib is too rounded where the two tines meet, preventing the capillary action needed for the ink to draw down to the paper. Though very smooth writing, nibs with this symptom will typically have skipping problems.
- *Balance* - Refers to how evenly distributed the weight of the pen feels from the front and back in the hand, and it varies based on the person holding it. It can either feel evenly balanced, front (nib) heavy, or back (top) heavy.
- *Ballpoint* - What you're probably used to, a pen with a grease or paste ink that is used by rolling the tip (with a ball) across the paper, which rotates the ball and pulls ink from the pen. These came about around the 1950's and were the disruptive technology to the fountain pen that started their decline. Though a necessary tool, they provide a less-than-ideal writing experience due to their limited ink color options, erratic flow, and high amount of pressure required to write (relative to a fountain pen).
- *Band* - (Centerband) - The metal decorative ring that is usually placed near the bottom of the pen cap for decorative purposes, or perhaps to provide reinforcement to the cap threads.
- *Barrel* - The long part of the main body of the pen which houses the ink reservoir.
- *Biocide* - Chemicals used in fountain pen ink to prevent mold and other biological growths from, well, growing.
- *Bladder* - (Sac) - The rubbery sac that houses ink in various pen filling mechanisms, such as the aerometric.
- *Bleeding* - or *Bleedthrough* - A symptom of ink soaking through the paper so much that it crosses over to the other side of the page. This can vary based on the ink or the paper but is usually a symptom of paper that is too absorbent. It is more extreme than show-through or ghosting.
- *Blind Cap* - A removable cap that covers a pen's filling mechanism.
- *Blotter* - Usually made of wood or metal, this holds blotting paper that is used to soak up excess ink on a page to decrease drying time.
- *Blotting Paper* - Special super-absorbent paper (like J. Herbin's) that is used to soak up extra ink on the page without smearing it, to decrease dry time when needed.
- *Body* - The main part of the pen (the part without the cap), usually also called the barrel.
- *Blue-Black* - A common designation for a dark blue ink, though there really isn't any strict way to declare a blue-black apart from an ink that is just dark blue, navy, or midnight. The original term comes from iron gall or similar inks where the ink begins as a blue color, and over time fades into a dull black color.
- *Brassing* - When a plating wears off, exposing the underlying metal (usually brass).
- *Breather Hole* - A hole in the nib, at the end of the nib slit, that allows air to assist in the ink flow, also called a vent hole.
- *Breather Tube* - A small tube that is used to assist in filling certain types of pens, such as the Noodler's Ahab Flex Pen.
- *Bulb Filler* - A simple type of filling mechanism that uses a small rubber sac at the end of a large reservoir, and fills by squeezing the sac.
- *Bulb Syringe* - A handy tool used to either suction boogies from your baby's nose or to help flush out cartridge/converter fountain pens while cleaning
- *Bulletproof* - A Noodler's term used to describe ink that is particularly fraud resistant and can withstand water, UV rays, bleach, oven cleaners, etc.
- *Burping* - A symptom (particularly with eyedropper filled pens) where ink comes out in a large drip or blob out of the grip section of the pen. This is usually caused by a variance in pressure between the inside of the pen and the surrounding environment, such as on an airplane with changing pressure or with a pen that has a large reservoir that is low on ink (mostly air) where the heat from your hand while writing can increase the pressure in the pen.
- *Button Filler* - A filling mechanism that works by pushing a button, more common in vintage pens.
- *CA (cyanoacrylate)* - Superglue, basically.
- *Calligraphy* - Fancy writing, often done with dip pens but can be emulated with italic nibs.
- *Calligraphy Pens* - A term almost always used to describe italic nib fountain pens, usually in the lower price range and sold in sets to lure writers in who want to make their handwriting appear like calligraphy. True calligraphy pens are typically dip pens, which do not use a feed like fountain pens.
- *Cap* - The part of a pen that covers the nib and attaches to the pen body.
- *Capillary Action* - The ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the external forces like gravity. This is the basis for how a fountain pen works.
- *Cartridge* - A small, sealed plastic reservoir that holds fountain pen ink. Many pen brands use their own proprietary style, but there is one common style called Standard International, where many pen makers use the same type of cartridge. The benefit of cartridges is the convenience, however, they are not nearly as economical as bottled pen ink and the color range is usually incredibly limited
- *Cartridge/Converter (C/C)* - A small filling mechanism (usually a screw-piston type) that fits onto a pen that also accepts a cartridge. This allows you to use any brand's bottled ink instead of relying on limited proprietary ink cartridges.
- *Clip* - The metal doohickey usually attached to the cap that holds your pen in your shirt pocket and also keeps it from rolling off your desk and landing nib first on the ground (why does it ALWAYS fall nib down??).
- *Conversion* - When you are altering a pen in some way to provide an alternate filling method. The most common practice is using a 'cartridge converter' to use bottled ink in a pen in place of ink cartridges, or in filling the whole body of a pen with ink (this is the eyedropper method).
- *Converter* - A cartridge-shaped reservoir that allows you to use bottled pen ink when a cartridge would otherwise be your only option. Pens that have this option are usually referred to as cartridge/converter or C/C.
- *Corrosion* - When the metal parts of your pen either rust or chemically disintegrate due to chemical exposure or oxidation.
- *Crack* - When your pen material (usually plastic) splits apart. This is usually caused by stress in some way, either due to extreme force (like dropping your pen on a hard surface) or over-tightening of certain parts.
- *Crisp* - (Italic) - A nib ground so that the tip is flat, with very sharp edges to give a very distinct line variation from cross-stroke to downstroke. These nibs require you to write slowly and hold the pen at a very specific angle, otherwise, the sharp edges of the nib will tear the paper.
- *Cursive* - (Italic) - A nib ground so that the tip is flat, but with slightly more rounded edges. This sacrifices a bit of line variation, for the benefit of a smoother and more forgiving writing experience than a crisp italic. This nib is sometimes called a 'stub', though a stub is typically even more rounded than the cursive italic.
- *Demonstrator* - Transparent pens, originally developed for salesmen to show to distributors and retailers to display the inner workings of the pens' parts. Now, it is a common aesthetic design adopted across many brands. The appeal is that you can see the ink level clearly in your pen without having to take it apart.
- *Dip Pen* - A writing instrument that doesn't have an internal ink reservoir, it instead must have its nib immersed in ink every few words to keep it writing. Dip pens typically use ink that is thicker (usually shellac-based) than fountain pen ink.
- *Dip Test* - When you want to get an idea of how a particular color of ink will look in your fountain pen, but you don't want to draw ink all the way up into it (thus meaning you have to do a full cleaning), you instead just immerse the nib into the ink and write with it without ever drawing ink into the pen.
- *Drawing Ink* - (India Ink) - Ink that is composed of a fine soot that is combined with water and a binding agent such as shellac. This ink is more durable and permanent than fountain pen ink, but should only be reserved for use with dip pens.
- *Dry* - When ink does not flow very freely or heavily out of a pen. This can be either a characteristic of a pen or an ink, but both are referring to the same end result of a limited amount of ink coming out of the pen.
- *Ebonite* - A hard rubber material commonly used in vintage (and some modern) pens.
- *Eternal* - A term coined by Noodler's Ink to describe the properties of a fountain pen ink that is resistant to UV exposure and fading over a long period of time.
- *Eyedropper* - Not specific to any brand, a type of filling method where the entire body of the pen is used as a reservoir for the ink.
- *Eyedropper Conversion* - The process of modifying a fountain pen that has an existing filling mechanism (such as cartridge/converter, piston, or aerometric) so that the entire body of the pen can be used as an ink reservoir.
- *Feathering* - A term used to describe when fountain pen ink soaks into absorbent paper, resulting in a veiny pattern that branches out from the line drawn. It can also be referred to as 'spread'.
- *Feed* - The piece of plastic or ebonite (usually black) that hugs the back of the nib and acts as a vehicle for ink delivery from the reservoir to the nib.
- *Feedback* - The amount of 'bite' or resistance perceived during a writing experience. This is a consequence of the relationship between the smoothness of a fountain pen nib and the smoothness of the paper being used. Also commonly referred to as 'tooth'.
- *Feed Channel* - A very thin slit in the feed that hugs against the back of the nib and provides a route for the ink to travel through the feed. This is what helps to provide the necessary capillary action required for ink flow.
- *Ferrogallic* - (Iron Gall) Ink - Ink made from iron salts and tannic acids. Though quite permanent and waterproof, these inks are typically known for causing chemical corrosion to metal pen parts (especially the nib) and should be used sparingly or with less-valuable pens. Modern iron gall formulations are not as harmful as the inks of the past, but extra precaution such as not leaving the ink in a pen for more than a week is strongly recommended.
- *Filigree* - a decorative (usually precious) metal overlay with openings that show the material of the pen under it.
- *Flex* - The ability of the tines of a fountain pen nib to spread under varying writing pressure, resulting in variation of the width of the line drawn. It's super cool.
- *Flooding* - Forcing ink down through the feed by intentionally pushing it out of the reservoir.
- *Flow* - The movement of ink through the pen. Often described as 'wet' or 'dry', depending on how freely the ink is willing to come out of the pen.
- *Fluorescing* - When ink glows under blacklight.
- *Freeze Resistant* - Ink that is formulated to resist freezing at extremely low temperatures.
- *French-Ruled Paper* - (Séyès) - Standard 'school' paper in France, it is an 8mm x 8mm grid that is separated by 2mm horizontal lines to give guidance and structure to cursive writing.
- *Gel Pen* - A disposable cartridge-type pen that has a gel-based ink inside it (such as Pilot G2).
- *Ghosting* - When you can see what's written on the other side of a sheet of paper without the ink coming through the page. This isn't to be confused with bleed through, where the ink actually soaks through to the other side. This is also known as show-through or echo.
- *Glass Pen* - A writing instrument that must be dipped in ink and provides ink delivery the paper through a series of twisted flutes on the tip....and it's glass, duh.
- *Gold* - You know what this is. Typically used for nibs on more expensive pens or as plating for decoration on fountain pen hardware.
- *GSM* - (aka 'g' or gm^2) grams per square meter, a measurement of a paper's weight. Though this designation is commonly used to refer to a paper's thickness, not all papers with the same GSM may be the same thickness, because there are other factors involved such as the material of the paper and the sizing used that influence how heavy it is. Generally speaking though, it is best to use papers that are 80g weight or higher for good performance with fountain pens (though there are of course always exceptions).
- *Grip section* - The part of the pen you hold where the nib fits in, sometimes called just a 'section'.
- *Halo* - An ink property where there is an intentional separation of dye components to give a highlighting effect.
- *Hardware* - The metal ornamentation on a pen, usually referring to the clip, finial, and center band. Also called 'trim'.
- *Highlighter* - Fountain pen inks that are designed to be used to highlight on top of written or printed ink.
- *Hood(ed) Nib* - A covering that goes over the top of a nib to make it less likely that you will touch it and get ink on your fingers. Made famous by the Parker 51.
- *India Ink* - Ink that is composed of a fine soot that is combined with water and a binding agent such as shellac. This ink is more durable and permanent than fountain pen ink, but should only be reserved for use with dip pens.
- *Ink* - The liquid substance that you put in a fountain pen to be able to use it for more than a paperweight or a piece of jewelry.
- *Ink Syringe* - A hypodermic needle (ideally blunt-tip) that is used to refill ink cartridges or decant the last bit of ink from a bottle.
- *Ink Window* - a translucent section of a pen that allows you to see when your ink level is getting low.
- *Inkwell* - A storage container used for housing liquid ink, usually made of glass.
- *Insert* - A cone-shaped reservoir that seats inside a bottle of ink to help you fill a fountain pen when the ink level gets low.
- *Invisible* - Fountain pen ink that is clear and is nearly invisible on paper to the naked eye when written with. These inks can be viewed later using other means, like specific lighting conditions.
- *Iridium* - A very hard-wearing metal (usually some kind of alloy) used for tipping material on fountain pen nibs.
- *Iridium Point Germany (IPG)* - A designation displayed on some manufacturer's nibs. Iridium refers to the hard-wearing metal used to create the ball on the tip of the nib, and the German aspect could mean a variety of things. It doesn't necessarily mean the nib was made in Germany, but just that (at least) the tipping material used for the point comes from Germany. This is quite confusing and does create some mystery about where some nibs actually come from. Brian Gray of the Edison Pen Company has a great article on the [IPG Nib designation](http://edisonpen.com/ipgnibs2).
- *Iron Gall* - Ink made from iron salts and tannic acids. Though quite permanent and waterproof, these inks are typically known for causing chemical corrosion to metal pen parts (especially the nib) and should be used sparingly or with less-valuable pens. Modern iron gall formulations are not as harmful as the inks of the past, but extra precaution such as not leaving the ink in a pen for more than a week is strongly recommended.
- *Italic* - (Nib) - A type of grind where the tip of the nib is flattened so that there is a distinct line variation while you write when you change from the cross-stroke to the down-stroke.
- *Lacquer* - Clear or colored varnish that's used to provide protection and durability to a pen's surface.
- *Limited Edition (LE)* - Pens that are designed to be made in only limited numbers. They are often engraved with a designation with which number pen it is.
- *Lubricated* - Ink that has special additives to make it flow better in your pen, and keep the internal components operating smoothly. Noodler's American Eel series of inks are most known for this property.
- *Maki-e* - Japanese lacquer sprinkled with precious metal powder as a decoration. There are several different methods of this technique, but all of them are extremely cool, very hard to do, and take forever to do, which makes pens with maki-e very expensive.
- *Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK)* - Also known as butanone, this is used as a chemical welding agent to affix pen parts together.
- *Mixable *\- Fountain pen inks that are designed to be mixed together to create new colors without adverse reactions between inks.
- *Mold* - Spore growth in ink, commonly called SITB (Stuff In The Bottle). Mold is a 'four-letter-word' in the fountain pen ink world, and generally very frowned upon. It can either come up as white fuzzy stuff on the surface of the ink where you can see it as soon as you open a bottle or as sludge down inside the ink that is much harder to find until you suck it up into your pen. Though mold is quite scary, it seldom actually causes any long-term damage to a pen. Most ink companies put biocides in their inks to prevent the growth of mold, so it is rare that it occurs.
- *Music Nib* - A type of stub/italic nib that is designed for increased ink flow. Platinum and Sailor both have nibs they call Music Nibs, and they are really little more than regular stub nibs. Traditionally these nibs have three tines (two slits).
- *Nail* - Nibs that have no flexibility at all, that write as stiff as a....nail.
- *Newbie (Noob)* - Someone brand new to the world of fountain pens.
- *Nib* - The metal tip of a fountain pen that actually touches the paper.
- *Nib Creep* - When ink comes up through the nib tines and covers part of the top of the nib. It can be a symptom of the ink or pen, but is purely aesthetic and doesn't typically have any effect on the function of a pen.
- *NID* - New Ink Day, when your new ink shipment arrives.
- *NPD* - New Pen Day, when your new fountain pen arrives.
- *Oblique* - A nib grind that is like an italic, but slanted to one side (either left or right). This grind is quite rare these days and is hard to find unless you have it custom ground.
- *O-Ring* - A rubber ring that helps to seal internal components of a pen from leaking ink.
- *Overwriter* - Someone who writes with their hand on the page so that it sits above where the nib is writing. This term is most commonly used to describe left-handed writers, as it creates a special problem due to the fact that the hand would be rubbing directly over what's being written.
- *Palladium* - A durable silvery-white precious metal in the platinum family used by some pen manufacturers in their pens.
- *Permanent* - Traditionally, a fountain pen ink that is water resistant and fade resistant. In more rare cases, permanent ink can even be acid proof, UV resistant, forgery-resistant and more.
- *Pigmented* - Fountain pen ink that is made up of finely-ground solid particles in liquid suspension, like paint. Some brands make specially-formulated pigmented ink for use in fountain pens, where the solid matter is microscopically ground to the point where it can flow through feeds.
- *Piston* - A type of mechanism that uses a retracting plunger inside a sealed tube in fountain pens and converters to draw ink into a pen. They can either be screw or push operated, though screw pistons are the most common.
- *Piston Filler* - A fountain pen that has a piston filling mechanism built into the body of it, so that the body of the pen acts as the ink reservoir.
- *Plating* - When a coating of one metal goes overtop of another, usually to provide added wear protection and aesthetic appeal.
- *Plunger* - The rod inside a piston that moves up and down to draw ink in and out of a pen (or converter).
- *Posting* - When you put the cap of a pen onto the back end of the body (the part you hold).
- *Precious Resin* - A marketing term, most famously used by Mont Blanc, that essentially means plastic.
- *Prime* - When you soak a pen feed with ink to get it started. This happens as a consequence of filling a pen through its nib when filling from a bottle of ink, but you can also prime a pen by forcing ink down through the feed by reversing the filling mechanism from the way you filled it.
- *Proprietary* - Refers to components that are designed and made to fit specifically one brand, as opposed to being universal. Examples would include LAMY nibs fitting only on LAMY pens, or Pilot ink cartridges fitting only on Pilot pens.
- *Railroading* - When the flow of ink is broken and the result is that the tines of the nib draw two separate, parallel lines on the page. This is most common using flexible nib pens.
- *Reservoir* - A cavity inside a pen that holds ink.
- *Resin* - Plastic.
- *Retractable Nib* - A pen that is designed without a cap, so that the nib itself draws into the pen body when closed. The most popular pens that do this are the Pilot Vanishing Point and Lamy Dialog 3. This is a common feature of ballpoint (click) pens, but not common in fountain pens.
- *Rhodium* - An extremely durable (and expensive) silver-colored metal most often used for plating over stainless steel to provide added durability to pen hardware and nibs.
- *Rocking Blotter* - A tool (usually wood) that hold sheets of specially absorbent blotting paper that is used to soak up excess ink left on paper.
- *Rollerball* - A pen that contains a gel ink that is housed inside a replaceable cartridge.
- *Sac* - a rubbery reservoir that houses ink. Common in many vintage pens, they're used much less often today.
- *Saturation* - An ink term used to describe the perceived intensity of a specific color. Ink users often refer to the level of saturation of an ink by how much dye is perceived to be present in the ink. Generally speaking, the higher saturated inks have bolder colors but extended drying times on paper.
- *Scented* - Fountain pen ink that is formulated to have a specific smell, generally corresponding with the ink name.
- *Scratchy* - When a nib provides resistance when being moved across the paper, often caused by misaligned nib tines.
- *Screw Cap* - A pen cap that is removed/replaced by interlocking threads on the cap and pen body that mate together with a twisting motion.
- *Section* - The part of the pen you hold where the nib fits in, often called a 'grip section'.
- *Semi-Flex* - When a nib bends slightly under pressure to give a soft feel when writing, not to the extreme of flex nibs where the nib tines actually separate to provide line variation.
- *Séyès (French-Ruled) Paper* - Standard 'school' paper in France, it is an 8mm x 8mm grid that is separated by 2mm horizontal lines to give guidance and structure to cursive writing.
- *Shading* - A common (and often desired) result of a fountain pen ink pooling in certain parts of a letter when writing, so that the color and saturation of the ink appears different within a single letter or word. This characteristic cannot be achieved with ballpoint or rollerball pens and is a very appealing aspect of fountain pen use for those particularly drawn to all the pretty ink colors.
- *Sheen* - Characteristic of a fountain pen ink where when ink pools another color can be seen on top of the ink, especially when looked at in different light angles using certain paper types.
- *Shimmering* - Fountain pen ink that has small particles of glitter mixed in.
- *Show-Through* - When you can see what's written on the other side of a sheet of paper without the ink coming through the page. This isn't to be confused with bleed through, where the ink actually soaks through to the other side. This is also known as ghosting or echo.
- *Silicone Grease* - A clear, inert grease that is used to lubricate moving parts of fountain pens, as well as seal up threads for eyedropper conversions. The appeal of this grease is that it doesn't harden over time, it is water/ink-resistant, and it will not react with fountain pen inks.
- *SITB* - "Stuff In The Bottle", a term used to describe mold, sludge, chemical sedimentation, or some other 'strange' foreign substance present in a bottle of pen ink.
- *Sizing *\- A coating for paper that affects its ability to absorb liquids (like ink). Heavily sized papers are typically more ideal for fountain pens because they are smoother and more ink repellant.
- *Skipping* - When ink doesn't flow consistently from a pen, causing the ink to start and stop flowing as you write. This could be caused by the pen, paper, ink, or any combination of the three.
- *Slit* - The very thin cut running from the tip of the nib up to the breather hole that carries the ink from the feed to the tip of the nib.
- *Snap Cap* - A pen cap that is removed/replaced by pulling/pushing onto the pen body, usually resulting in a clicking sound.
- *Soft* - A term used to describe a nib that is springy and somewhat flexible.
- *Special Edition (SE)* - Similar to a limited edition, but typically without individual serial numbers. A product produced for a limited period of time.
- *Stainless Steel* - A very common alloy used in the making of fountain pen parts, particularly nibs.
- *Standard International* - The most commonly accepted size of fountain pen ink cartridges and converters that many manufacturers use. Many pen companies use all proprietary parts for their pens, but the only real 'common' standard for ink cartridge and converters that crosses into multiple brands is the Standard International. There are both short cartridges (most common) and long cartridges that are considered Standard International size.
- *Stub* - A nib that is ground so that the tip is slightly wider than it is tall, resulting in a variation in line width when switching between writing on the cross-stroke and down-stroke. This is similar to an italic nib, but with more rounded edges to make writing smoother and more enjoyable for everyday use.
- *Syringe* - A tool used to refill ink cartridges, get last bits of ink out of a bottle, clean pen parts, and fill certain pens such as eyedropper pens.
- *Taper* - When the diameter of a pen part gradually gets smaller.
- *Threads* - Thin grooves cut into a pen to hold parts together, especially pen caps to the pen body.
- *Tip* - The small ball part on the end of a fountain pen nib that actually touches the paper when writing.
- *Tipping Material* - A small bit of hard-wearing metal (usually some sort of iridium alloy) that is welded to the end of a nib and ground to a specific intended size.
- *Tooth* - The amount of 'bite' or resistance perceived during a writing experience. This is a consequence of the relationship between the smoothness of a fountain pen nib and the smoothness of the paper being used. Also commonly referred to as 'feedback'.
- *Translucent* - When a pen material is not entirely opaque, and you can see light coming through it. This comes in handy with fountain pens when you want to be able to see your ink level at a glance.
- *Trim* - The metal ornamentation on a pen, usually referring to the clip, finial, and center band. Also called 'hardware'.
- *Two-Tone* - When two different metals are used next to each other, often on a fountain pen nib. Often it is yellow gold and rhodium.
- *Urushi* - An extremely durable and beautiful Japanese lacquer derived from Urushi trees. The urushi lacquer process is very skill and time intensive, and quite hazardous when wet since it contains urushiol, the active ingredient in poison ivy. When cured, it creates an incredibly hard and durable finish for pens and can be polished to a very high sheen.
- *UV* - Ultra-violet, radiation that affects ink colors in particular to cause fading.
- *Vacuum-Fill* - A design of pen that uses a combination of pressure and vacuum to create suction to fill a fountain pen with ink.
- *Vegetal* - A type of resin that's used for making fountain pens, most notably Noodler's brand. It has a very distinct smell when manufactured, though it does weaken over time. It is also fully biodegradable when buried underground.
- *Vent Hole* - A hole in the nib, at the end of the nib slit, that allows air to assist in the ink flow, also called a breather hole.
- *Water Resistance* - Very rarely is an ink ever "waterproof" and is completely unaffected by water. More often than not, water resistant inks are just that: resistant in some ways to the fading effects brought on by exposure to water. Water resistance means that a portion of the ink will remain after being subjected to water. This might only be one ingredient of the ink, leaving behind a legible remnant with little or no representation of the original color.
- *Wet* - When ink flows very freely and heavily out of a pen. This can be either a characteristic of a pen or an ink, but both are referring to the same end result of a generous amount of ink coming out of the pen.
- *Wet Noodle* - A flexible nib pen that is incredibly flexible with even the slightest of pressure. These pens were more common around the turn of the 20th century, and are now coveted in the vintage pen market and sold at an absolute premium.

> Gouache (; French: [ɡwaʃ]), body color, or opaque watercolor, is a water-medium paint consisting of natural pigment, water, a binding agent (usually gum arabic or dextrin), and sometimes additional inert material. Gouache is designed to be opaque. Gouache has a considerable history, having been used for at least twelve centuries. It is used most consistently by commercial artists for posters, illustrations, comics, and other design work. 

> Gouache is similar to watercolor in that it can be re-wetted and dries to a matte finish, and the paint can become infused into its paper support. It is similar to acrylic or oil paints in that it is normally used in an opaque painting style and it can form a superficial layer. Many manufacturers of watercolor paints also produce gouache, and the two can easily be used together.

“[Hermitage (religious retreat)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitage_(religious_retreat))” - *Wikipedia*

A hermitage most authentically refers to a place where a hermit lives in seclusion from the world, or a building or settlement where a person or a group of people lived religiously, in seclusion. Particularly as a name or part of the name of properties its meaning is often imprecise, harking to a distant period of local history, components of the building material, or recalling any former sanctuary or holy place. Secondary churches or establishments run from a monastery were often called "hermitages".

In the 18th century, some owners of English country houses adorned their gardens with a "hermitage", sometimes a Gothic ruin, but sometimes, as at Painshill Park, a romantic hut which a "hermit" was recruited to occupy. The so-called Ermita de San Pelayo y San Isidoro is the ruins of a Romanesque church of Ávila, Spain that ended up several hundred miles away, to feature in the Buen Retiro Park in Madrid.

# How I Maintain a Vocabulary List in Drafts with Terminology

As I wrote in [my app store review of Terminology](https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews/terminology) (which is not shown publicly, I’ve since learned,) I prefer it over popular dictionary apps like [LookUp](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448) (which I also have and use regularly) because it allows me to *add new terms* that don’t show up in search results. Somehow, the idea that one might store words that don’t necessarily appear in any dictionary seems a foreign one to the creators of LookUp, which I’ve since found out to be the cause of [its Siri Shortcuts actions failing on me](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328).

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328

[Terminology](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859) *does* support adding “custom” terms, if unintentionally, through its “notes” function. Because it’s related to Drafts (they’re from the same creator,) it was quite easy to “integrate” the two in order to form the workflow you see demonstrated in [the video below](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/165031796-5df78c01-faee-4fd4-84d0-f0bf95fd383f.MOV).

First, I use the [Lookup in Terminology action](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1CS) paired with a keyboard shortcut (`^⇧D`) in Drafts to search a selected word in Terminology. There, I “like” the word and - if needed - add a definition via the notes button (immediately to the left of the heart in the upper right corner.) I’ve configured a custom button - “[Drafts-definition](terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&shortName=Drafts&description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&dispatchType=0
terminology://x-callback-url/importAction?name=Drafts-definition&shortName=Drafts&description=Send%20term%20and%20full%20Markdown%20definitions%20to%20Drafts&urlTemplate=drafts://create?text%3D%5B%5Bdefinitions%5D%5D%250A%5B%5Bnote%5D%5D&dispatchType=0)” - (which you should be able to import with that hyperlink) that sends the term *including its notes* back to Drafts with the following configuration:

```
drafts://create?text=[[definitions]]%0A[[note]]
```

That button results in a new Draft in a specific format, demonstrated by this example:

![Antagonistic Vocabulary Draft Example](https://i.snap.as/K0adnLf5.png)

I then manually add the “Vocabulary” tag to the Draft, completing the process and placing it within the parameters defined by [my Vocabulary workspace](https://directory.getdrafts.com/w/1zN), which shows only drafts with that tag, sorted alphabetically.

## Publication

For the past few weeks, I’ve been wreaking havoc on NeoCities’ global activity feed using [the action group I created](https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities) on [the /drafts directory](https://davidblue.wtf/drafts) of davidblue dot wtf. Specifically, the action that uploads HTML files to that directory named by the UUID of the draft. (Here’s [the corresponding link for this post](https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/F20BB579-E235-4F04-8BCE-22AAF15A97C2.html), for example.) With consequent [draft_open_urls](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates#identifier-tags) left in the footer of each as per my current, more or less universal [HTML template](https://tilde.town/~extratone/template/1.4.txt), I’m able to immediately open the appropriate draft locally. 

![Vocabulary Index Shortcut](https://i.snap.as/2npm338t.png)

In order to maintain [an updated index](https://davidblue.wtf/vocabulary) of the whole list, I’ve created [a Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/113f8e45729c4466860c3c7c668e939d) which transforms the UUIDs of the drafts in the vocabulary workspace into markdown-formatted hyperlinks of their web-dwelling counterparts.

![Terminology Favorites List](https://i.snap.as/D8GtXEd3.png)

Even if you’ve no intention of publishing your personal vocabulary - or integrating it with Drafts - Terminology is still the dictionary app I’d recommend over any others.

iconographic cannibalism

`2022.03.22 20:15` T - [bx](https://tilde.town/~bx/)
as far as im aware "iconographic cannibalism" is a phrase
that im gur first to put into use, i came up with it to
describe a specific phenomenon where i dont want to eat
things that looks too much like inocent or other wise joy
filled human beings, this includes ginger bread people,
some kinds of cake(m&s sells one that looks like a plump
anropomorphised catipillar named collin) and also gur
licorice allsort that looks like gur mascot, which is
just a person shaped collection of licorice allsorts (and
in gur actual pack its a smaller piece of single licorice
shaped gur same way).

ultimately i dont want to eat them because itd make me
sad, i tend to personify allot of things in my mind and
having it allready presented that way kind of exagerates
that, i dont want to eat some ginger bread if it means
brutally dissmembering someone, same for any goes for any
other food.

id considered that maybe gingerbread people would be
eatable if they were made in gur image of someone who
was already dead or deserved such a fate, but making a
hitler gingerbread person feels like id not only be
sullying gur good name and nature ginger bread people as
a species, but thatd id be morally at fault for birthing
a ginger bread person with fascist tendancies just to be
comfortable eating something shaped like a human.
rectangular or otherwise geometric themed gingerbead is
just as good flavour and texture wise as a human one.
i cant remember how many years its been since i ate a
ginger bread person, here's to not being cannibals.

just in case you want further thoughts from me (lol...) 

I have been intermittently noodling on the whole concept of automated dictionary interaction for the past year - my very first API call was to Merriam-Webster just ~18 months ago and well... I'm sure you have some idea of just how hard it is to figure out a format/schema for automation when interacting with such ... varying API responses. I think LookUp's magic/greatest potential lies in the fact that you've figured out a way to present a wide variety of results from a fairly diverse set of sources in a truly usable manner. I think the opportunity to be a bridge/filter/parser between often impractical/untenable/overwhelming academic data and like... normal, reasonable, working, but still curious users is very exciting! honestly the elegance you've managed to achieve in that vein is extraordinary.

*but*

maybe - in the form of Siri Shortcuts actions, specifically - you could experiment with being just a bit less discriminating in terms of the data from your sources you're willing to provide to the user since one could argue that the use of automation sort of by its nature is explicit consent to/desire for more verbosity. I know it certainly is in my case.

also, I can't believe it took me this long to recall that I actually took the time to describe my vocabulary workflow not so long ago, if you're curious. https://bilge.world/drafts-terminology-vocabulary

oh and! here's my published vocabulary index. https://davidblue.wtf/vocabulary

> honestly, that's a big offer!

> generally, being able to add custom terms with metadata/details and being able to retrieve more details would certainly benefit *my* workflow significantly. one of my very first hiccups with LookUp (and still sorta the reason I store my primary vocabulary list in Terminology (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859) instead) is the fact that the `Add Word to Collection` action will fail (and interrupt a repeat loop) if passed a term that does not show up in search results.

## Quickly copy markdown-formatted LookUp share hyperlinks from the share sheet.

![LookUp URL Shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193440666-579af32d-66c3-4859-b275-63efc3724a54.png)

This shortcut anticipates the upcoming addition of individual term share URLs to [**LookUp**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448) for iOS/iPadOS/macOS (and therefore requires one currently be running a [Testflight build](https://testflight.apple.com/join/L8DSerhw).)

By default, it should be present in the share sheet, from which it receives URLs, extracts the term from the URL format, formats the results as a markdown hyperlink, which it then copies to the system clipboard. 

### Example Input

`https://learnwithlookup.com/share/index.html?word=hyperlink&definition=link%2520from%2520hypertext%2520document%2520to%2520another%2520location,%2520activated%2520by%2520clicking%2520on%2520highlighted%2520word%2520or%2520image&data=eyJpbWFnZSI6IiIsIndvcmQiOiJoeXBlcmxpbmsiLCJkZWZpbml0aW9uIjoibGluayBmcm9tIGh5cGVydGV4dCBkb2N1bWVudCB0byBhbm90aGVyIGxvY2F0aW9uLCBhY3RpdmF0ZWQgYnkgY2xpY2tpbmcgb24gaGlnaGxpZ2h0ZWQgd29yZCBvciBpbWFnZSJ9`

### Example Output

```

I think the opportunity to be a bridge/filter/parser between often impractical/untenable/overwhelming academic data and like... normal, reasonable, working, but still curious users is very exciting! honestly the elegance you've managed to achieve in that vein is extraordinary.

*but*

maybe - in the form of Siri Shortcuts actions, specifically - you could experiment with being just a bit less discriminating in terms of the data from your sources you're willing to provide to the user since one could argue that the use of automation sort of by its nature is explicit consent to/desire for more verbosity. I know it certainly is in my case.

also, I can't believe it took me this long to recall that I actually took the time to describe my vocabulary workflow not so long ago, if you're curious. https://bilge.world/drafts-terminology-vocabulary

## Quickly copy markdown-formatted LookUp share hyperlinks from the share sheet.

![LookUp URL Shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/193440666-579af32d-66c3-4859-b275-63efc3724a54.png)

This shortcut anticipates the upcoming addition of individual term share URLs to [**LookUp**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448) for iOS/iPadOS/macOS (and therefore requires one currently be running a [Testflight build](https://testflight.apple.com/join/L8DSerhw).)

By default, it should be present in the share sheet, from which it receives URLs, extracts the term from the URL format, formats the results as a markdown hyperlink, which it then copies to the system clipboard. 

### Example Input

`https://learnwithlookup.com/share/index.html?word=hyperlink&definition=link%2520from%2520hypertext%2520document%2520to%2520another%2520location,%2520activated%2520by%2520clicking%2520on%2520highlighted%2520word%2520or%2520image&data=eyJpbWFnZSI6IiIsIndvcmQiOiJoeXBlcmxpbmsiLCJkZWZpbml0aW9uIjoibGluayBmcm9tIGh5cGVydGV4dCBkb2N1bWVudCB0byBhbm90aGVyIGxvY2F0aW9uLCBhY3RpdmF0ZWQgYnkgY2xpY2tpbmcgb24gaGlnaGxpZ2h0ZWQgd29yZCBvciBpbWFnZSJ9`

Noun
1.	a person who is dissatisfied and rebellious
it was too late to stop the malcontents with a show of force


Adjective
1.	dissatisfied and complaining or making trouble
the malcontent generals saw their role as leaders of this counterrevolution

## Origin

late 16th century: from French, from mal ‘badly, ill’ + content ‘pleased’

## Wikipedia

The malcontent is a character type that often appeared in early modern drama. The character is discontented with the social structure and other characters in the play, and is often an outsider who observes and comments on the action, and may even acknowledge they are in a play. Shakespeare's Richard III, Iago in Othello, and Jaques in As You Like It are typical malcontents.

The role is usually both political and dramatic, with the malcontent voicing dissatisfaction with the usually Machiavellian political atmosphere and often using asides to build up a kind of self-consciousness and awareness of the text itself that other characters in the play lack.Important malcontents include Bosola in Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, Vindice in Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy, Malevole in Marston's The Malcontent, and Hamlet in Shakespeare's Hamlet.

The morality and sympathy of the malcontent is highly variable, as in the examples above. Sometimes, as in Hamlet and The Malcontent, they are the sympathetic centre of the play, whereas Iago is a very unsympathetic character. The most important thing about the malcontent is that the character is malcontent—unhappy, unsettled, displeased with the world of the play, eager to change it somehow, or to dispute with it.The malcontent is an objective or quasi-objective voice that comments on the play's concerns as though somehow above or beyond them. The concept has much to do with the Renaissance idea of humorism and a surfeit of "black bile" which caused melancholy.There is an ontological argument regarding Iago: if a malcontent is dissatisfied due to a displacement from their place in the social order, then Iago does not fit. His scheming and disaffection is not clearly motivated by resentment stemming from an injustice done to him.

## Wiki
Meliorism (Latin melior, better) is the idea that progress is a real concept leading to an improvement of the world. It holds that humans can, through their interference with processes that would otherwise be natural, produce an outcome which is an improvement over the aforementioned natural one.

Meliorism, as a conception of the person and society, is at the foundation of contemporary liberal democracy and human rights and is a basic component of liberalism.Another important understanding of the meliorist tradition comes from the American Pragmatic tradition.  One can read about it in the works of Lester Frank Ward, William James, and John Dewey. In James' works, however, meliorism does not pinpoint to progressivism and/or optimism. For James   meliorism stands in the middle between optimism and pessimism, and treats the salvation of the world as a probability rather than a certainty or impossibility. In the case of a meliorist praxis, the activist contemporary of the Pragmatists Jane Addams  stripped progressive ideals of any elitist privilege calling for a "lateral progress" whose concern was squarely with the common people.Meliorism has also been used by Arthur Caplan to describe positions in bioethics that are in favor of ameliorating conditions which cause suffering, even if the conditions have long existed (e.g. being in favor of cures for common diseases, being in favor of serious anti-aging therapies as they are developed).

A closely related concept discussed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Marquis de Condorcet is that of perfectibility of man. 

Condorcet's statement, "Such is the object of the work I have undertaken; the result of which will be to show, from reasoning and from facts, that no bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties; that the perfectibility of man is absolutely indefinite; that the progress of this perfectibility, henceforth above the control of every power that would impede it, has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us." anticipates James' meliorism.

Rousseau's treatment is somewhat weaker.Modern thinkers in this tradition are Hans Rosling and Max Roser. Roser expressed a melioristic position in the mission statement for Our World in Data. He said that all three statements are true at the same time "The world is much better. The world is awful. The world can be much better." Like William James before him Rosling held a halfway position between optimism and pessimism that emphasized humanity's capacity to improve their world.

Metadata is "data that provides information about other data", but not the content of the data, such as the text of a message or the image itself. There are many distinct types of metadata, including:
Descriptive metadata – the descriptive information about a resource. It is used for discovery and identification. It includes elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.
Structural metadata – metadata about containers of data and indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters. It describes the types, versions, relationships, and other characteristics of digital materials.

Administrative metadata – the information to help manage a resource, like resource type, permissions, and when and how it was created.

Reference metadata – the information about the contents and quality of statistical data.

Statistical metadata – also called process data, may describe processes that collect, process, or produce statistical data.

Legal metadata – provides information about the creator, copyright holder, and public licensing, if provided.Metadata is not strictly bounded to one of these categories, as it can describe a piece of data in many other ways.

Noun
1.	Philosophy (in Kantian philosophy) a thing as it is in itself, as distinct from a thing as it is knowable by the senses through phenomenal attributes.

## Wikipedia 

In philosophy, a noumenon (, ; from Ancient Greek  νoούμενον; plural noumena) is knowledge posited as an object that exists independently of human sense. The term noumenon is generally used in contrast with, or in relation to, the term phenomenon, which refers to any object of the senses. Immanuel Kant first developed the notion of the noumenon as part of his transcendental idealism, suggesting that while we know the noumenal world to exist because human sensibility is merely receptive, it is not itself sensible and must therefore remain otherwise unknowable to us. In Kantian philosophy, the noumenon is often associated with the unknowable "thing-in-itself" (German: Ding an sich). However, the nature of the relationship between the two is not made explicit in Kant's work, and remains a subject of debate among Kant scholars as a result.

Adjective
1.	having a strong religious or spiritual quality; indicating or suggesting the presence of a divinity
the strange, numinous beauty of this ancient landmark

## Origin

mid 17th century: from Latin numen, numin- ‘divine will’+ -ous

## Wikipedia

Numinous () is a term derived from the Latin numen, meaning "arousing spiritual or religious emotion; mysterious or awe-inspiring." The term was given its present sense by the German theologian and philosopher Rudolf Otto in his influential 1917 German book The Idea of the Holy. He also used the phrase mysterium tremendum as another description for the phenomenon. Otto's concept of the numinous influenced thinkers including Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade, and C. S. Lewis. It has been applied to theology, psychology, religious studies, literary analysis, and descriptions of psychedelic experiences.

Adjective
1.	having a strong religious or spiritual quality; indicating or suggesting the presence of a divinity
the strange, numinous beauty of this ancient landmark

## Origin

mid 17th century: from Latin numen, numin- ‘divine will’+ -ous

## Wikipedia

Numinous () is a term derived from the Latin numen, meaning "arousing spiritual or religious emotion; mysterious or awe-inspiring." The term was given its present sense by the German theologian and philosopher Rudolf Otto in his influential 1917 German book The Idea of the Holy. He also used the phrase mysterium tremendum as another description for the phenomenon. Otto's concept of the numinous influenced thinkers including Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade, and C. S. Lewis. It has been applied to theology, psychology, religious studies, literary analysis, and descriptions of psychedelic experiences.

# oligopoly


## Noun

1. (economics) a market in which control over the supply of a commodity is in the hands of a small number of producers and each one can influence prices and affect competitors
	- Less specific
		- market
		- marketplace
		- market place
	- Topic Members
		- economics
		- economic science

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligopoly)

An oligopoly (from Greek ὀλίγος, oligos "few" and πωλεῖν, polein "to sell") is a market structure in which a market or industry is dominated by a small number of large sellers or producers. Oligopolies often result from the desire to maximize profits, leading to collusion between companies. This reduces competition, leading to higher prices for consumers and lower wages for employees.

Many industries have been cited as oligopolistic, including civil aviation, electricity providers, the telecommunications sector, Rail freight markets, food processing, funeral services, sugar refining, beer making, pulp and paper making, and automobile manufacturing.

Most countries have laws outlawing anti-competitive behavior. EU competition law prohibits anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing and manipulating market supply and trade among competitors. In the US, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission are tasked with stopping collusion. However, corporations can evade legal consequences through tacit collusion, as collusion can only be proven through actual and direct communication between companies. 

It is possible for oligopolies to develop without collusion and in the presence of fierce competition among market participants. This is a situation similar to perfect competition, where oligopolists have their own market structure. In this situation, each company in the oligopoly has a large share in the industry and plays a pivotal, unique role.

## Wikipedia 

The Quaternary ( kwə-TUR-nə-ree, KWOT-ər-nerr-ee) is the current and most recent of the three periods of the Cenozoic Era in the geologic time scale of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). It follows the Neogene Period and spans from 2.58 million years ago to the present. The Quaternary Period is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene (2.58 million years ago to 11.7 thousand years ago) and the Holocene (11.7 thousand years ago to today, although a third epoch, the Anthropocene, has been proposed but is not yet officially recognised by the ICS).The Quaternary Period is typically defined by the cyclic growth and decay of continental ice sheets related to the Milankovitch cycles and the associated climate and environmental changes that they caused.

See the lyrics of Guerilla Maab's "[We Gone Swang](https://davidblue.wtf/drafts/E597F470-0B28-459B-9652-D2A647EDEB8F.html)" (from *Resurrected*) in their entirety, below.

```
[Hook - 2x]
We gone swang, lane to lane
Still gripping the wood grain, collecting my change
We gone swang, lane to lane
In the wide frame, on Fondren and Main
 
[Dougie D]
Fucking with G, the skating Escalade
Flossing all through the city, swanging from lane to lane
Gripping wooden grain, that's the way we do it mayn
On a constant grind working jelly, collecting change
In a wide frame, big body overloading the road
Hogging the street, just like they always be out of control
Roll with us, or you bitches get rolled over
Ain't no chip on my shoulder, I just got money to fold up
It's the Dougie Deezie, off of the heezy please believe me
Gotta be keeping it greasy, for me to see the cheesy
Doing it like it go, and there's one thing I know fa sho
We gon shine and gon hold, because the 3rd Coast is our home

[Trae]
See I'm a grain gripping, 83 swanger
Chromy glass, nigga you in danger
Got a sawed off, that'll repaint you
In a wide body, like the Lone Ranger
I'ma stop and drop, when I wanna roll
I got a big four do', with a big fo'-fo'
Sitting solo, Doug-O wrecked
Now Trae done backdo'
Ghetto superstar, menage tois
Candy paint, done wet up the car
Lane to lane, my drop'll get raw
Running red lights, and don't bar the law
Gotta get paid, stacking my change
Gripping the grain, gliding mayn
Turn out the back, and I'ma gon swang
Untamed, fin to do my thang
Now Trae done wrecked it, world respected
Out the Southside, of Houston Texas
Living wreckless, don't neglect it
Moving on, and ain't baring plexas
Bubble eyed, fin to lead the way
Diamonds shining, like a heat wave
Back it up, 'fore I blind your face
Slow Loud And Bangin', fin to lead the race

[Hook - 2x]

[Jay'Ton]
I swing blocks, when I'm in the drop
Where the throwed bops, and the haters jock
It's Jay'Ton on 84's, Volvos fin to glide the road
I'm 16 all in your face, braided up and I'm out of sight
With a bad dyke on a motor bike, screened up lighting up the night
I'm blue red coming out the I, turning heads on the boulevard
My AK'll make a nigga know, when I cock it back I'm fin to hit you hard
Southside fin to go get it, all about stacking a mill ticket
I'm still playa don't get it twisted, sideways with the trunk lifted

[Lil' B]
The window tinter, wood grain gripper
Wet candy paint, and a chrome pistol
Eyes on me, like a thoed stripper
Showing naked, better take a picture
On the boulevard we don't guard
84's and vogues, down to South Park
Cause I'm Lil' B, and I don't barge
Slow Loud And Bangin', we'll pull your car
That's on the Lord, we'll leave a stain
Hogging lanes, in a wide frame
With my nigga too, all against the grain
On the Dirty South, is where we gon swang
Riding two deep, or solo
Platinum FUBU, or Polo
With a bad hoe, rocking J-Lo
Skating up the block, I'm crawling slow

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Solid, as a rock
Profiling in the turning lane, banging down your block
Hell naw it just don't stop, matter fact it never slow down
When I'm in the kitchen whipping, my prices tend to go down
Then I dog my Intrepid, mash on the gas on down to the flo'
Till I hit my block and set up shop, anything you need come to the Ro
Might got prices on my head but I'm not scared, I'm gon shine
Relaxing in Rolls Royces, attempting to pass time
I be smoking on that stink, had to retire from that ink
Cause you just can't think, when your mind goes blank
Full tank of unleaded, then I'm head to Probilla
Fucking with that Big Mello, because my click require killas
You ain't gotta holla at me, when you see me outside
Cause when I go to my ride, I got your woman inside
She got her mouth open wide, ready for me to drop it in
My shine is unstoppable, but you wanna stop it here we go again

[Hook - 4x]

```
[Hook - 2x]
We gone swang, lane to lane
Still gripping the wood grain, collecting my change
We gone swang, lane to lane
In the wide frame, on Fondren and Main
 
[Dougie D]
Fucking with G, the skating Escalade
Flossing all through the city, swanging from lane to lane
Gripping wooden grain, that's the way we do it mayn
On a constant grind working jelly, collecting change
In a wide frame, big body overloading the road
Hogging the street, just like they always be out of control
Roll with us, or you bitches get rolled over
Ain't no chip on my shoulder, I just got money to fold up
It's the Dougie Deezie, off of the heezy please believe me
Gotta be keeping it greasy, for me to see the cheesy
Doing it like it go, and there's one thing I know fa sho
We gon shine and gon hold, because the 3rd Coast is our home

[Trae]
See I'm a grain gripping, 83 swanger
Chromy glass, nigga you in danger
Got a sawed off, that'll repaint you
In a wide body, like the Lone Ranger
I'ma stop and drop, when I wanna roll
I got a big four do', with a big fo'-fo'
Sitting solo, Doug-O wrecked
Now Trae done backdo'
Ghetto superstar, menage tois
Candy paint, done wet up the car
Lane to lane, my drop'll get raw
Running red lights, and don't bar the law
Gotta get paid, stacking my change
Gripping the grain, gliding mayn
Turn out the back, and I'ma gon swang
Untamed, fin to do my thang
Now Trae done wrecked it, world respected
Out the Southside, of Houston Texas
Living wreckless, don't neglect it
Moving on, and ain't baring plexas
Bubble eyed, fin to lead the way
Diamonds shining, like a heat wave
Back it up, 'fore I blind your face
Slow Loud And Bangin', fin to lead the race

[Hook - 2x]

[Jay'Ton]
I swing blocks, when I'm in the drop
Where the throwed bops, and the haters jock
It's Jay'Ton on 84's, Volvos fin to glide the road
I'm 16 all in your face, braided up and I'm out of sight
With a bad dyke on a motor bike, screened up lighting up the night
I'm blue red coming out the I, turning heads on the boulevard
My AK'll make a nigga know, when I cock it back I'm fin to hit you hard
Southside fin to go get it, all about stacking a mill ticket
I'm still playa don't get it twisted, sideways with the trunk lifted

[Lil' B]
The window tinter, wood grain gripper
Wet candy paint, and a chrome pistol
Eyes on me, like a thoed stripper
Showing naked, better take a picture
On the boulevard we don't guard
84's and vogues, down to South Park
Cause I'm Lil' B, and I don't barge
Slow Loud And Bangin', we'll pull your car
That's on the Lord, we'll leave a stain
Hogging lanes, in a wide frame
With my nigga too, all against the grain
On the Dirty South, is where we gon swang
Riding two deep, or solo
Platinum FUBU, or Polo
With a bad hoe, rocking J-Lo
Skating up the block, I'm crawling slow

[Hook - 2x]

[Z-Ro]
Solid, as a rock
Profiling in the turning lane, banging down your block
Hell naw it just don't stop, matter fact it never slow down
When I'm in the kitchen whipping, my prices tend to go down
Then I dog my Intrepid, mash on the gas on down to the flo'
Till I hit my block and set up shop, anything you need come to the Ro
Might got prices on my head but I'm not scared, I'm gon shine
Relaxing in Rolls Royces, attempting to pass time
I be smoking on that stink, had to retire from that ink
Cause you just can't think, when your mind goes blank
Full tank of unleaded, then I'm head to Probilla
Fucking with that Big Mello, because my click require killas
You ain't gotta holla at me, when you see me outside
Cause when I go to my ride, I got your woman inside
She got her mouth open wide, ready for me to drop it in
My shine is unstoppable, but you wanna stop it here we go again

[Hook - 4x]

*From Wikipedia*:
'''Theocracy''' is a form of government in which one or more [[deity|deities]] of some type are recognized as supreme ruling authorities, giving divine guidance to human intermediaries who manage the day-to-day affairs of the government.<ref>Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 edition).</ref><ref>"[https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/theocracy Theocracy, n.]" in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2015); Retrieved 28 June 2015</ref>

==Etymology==
The word theocracy originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word θεοκρατία (''theocratia'') meaning "the rule of God". This, in turn, derives from [[:wikt:θεός|θεός]] (theos), meaning "god", and [[:wikt:κρατέω|κρατέω]] (''krateo''), meaning "to rule". Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was "rule by god(s)" or human [[incarnation]](s) of god(s).

The term was initially coined by [[Flavius Josephus]] in the first century AD to describe the characteristic government of the [[Jew]]s. Josephus argued that while mankind had developed many forms of rule, most could be subsumed under the following three types: [[monarchy]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]]. However, according to Josephus, the government of the Jews was unique. Josephus offered the term "theocracy" to describe this polity in which God was sovereign and His word was law.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2849/2849-h/2849-h.htm|title=Against Apion by Flavius Josephus, Book II, Chapter 17|work=gutenberg.org|date=October 2001}}</ref>

Josephus' definition was widely accepted until the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, when the term took on negative [[connotation]]s and was barely salvaged by [[Hegel]]'s commentary.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moked|first=Oran|date=2004|title=The Relationship between Religion and State in Hegel's Thought|journal=Hegel Bulletin|language=en|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=96–112|doi=10.1017/S0263523200002032|issn=2051-5367|doi-access=free}}</ref> The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning "sacerdotal government under divine inspiration" (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning "priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power" was recorded in 1825.

==Definition==
{{tone|section|date=December 2016}}
The term ''theocracy'' derives from the [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|θεοκρατία}}, "rule of God", a term used by [[Josephus]] for the [[kingdoms of Israel and Judah]],<ref>English form the 17th century (''[[OED]]'').
The Greek term is explicitly coined by Josephus and isn't attested elsewhere in Ancient Greek; Josephus marks it as a [[Nonce word|nonce]] coinage by calling it a "strained expression".
W. Whiston tr. [[Josephus]], ''Against Apion'' ii. §17 (1814) IV. 340: "He [Moses] ordained our government to be what, by a strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy", translating  {{lang|grc|ὡς δ'ἄν τίς εἴποι, βιασάμενος τὸν λόγον, θεοκρατίαν}}
</ref> reflecting the view that "God himself is recognized as the head" of the state.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] "A form of civil government in which God himself is recognized as the head."</ref>
The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ecclesiocracy.<ref>Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/bth ''Biblical Theocracy: A vision of the biblical foundations for a Christian political philosophy''] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1993), introduced these more precise uses of the terms in arguing that theocracy (in this pure sense) is the only political system defended in the Bible. While Palmquist defends theocracy in this pure form as a viable (though "non-political") political system, he warns that what normally goes by this name is actually ecclesiocracy, the most dangerous of all political systems.</ref>

In a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the deity or deities of that civilization's religion or belief, such as [[Muhammad]]'s leadership of the early Muslims with prophecies from [[God in Islam|Allah]]. In an ecclesiocracy, the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation. 

A related phenomenon is a secular government co-existing with a state religion or delegating some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in Israel, [[Marriage in Israel|marriage]] is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion) exists, nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.

*From Wikipedia*:
'''Theocracy''' is a form of government in which one or more [[deity|deities]] of some type are recognized as supreme ruling authorities, giving divine guidance to human intermediaries who manage the day-to-day affairs of the government.<ref>Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1989 edition).</ref><ref>"[https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/theocracy Theocracy, n.]" in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2015); Retrieved 28 June 2015</ref>

==Etymology==
The word theocracy originates from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word θεοκρατία (''theocratia'') meaning "the rule of God". This, in turn, derives from [[:wikt:θεός|θεός]] (theos), meaning "god", and [[:wikt:κρατέω|κρατέω]] (''krateo''), meaning "to rule". Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was "rule by god(s)" or human [[incarnation]](s) of god(s).

The term was initially coined by [[Flavius Josephus]] in the first century AD to describe the characteristic government of the [[Jew]]s. Josephus argued that while mankind had developed many forms of rule, most could be subsumed under the following three types: [[monarchy]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]]. However, according to Josephus, the government of the Jews was unique. Josephus offered the term "theocracy" to describe this polity in which God was sovereign and His word was law.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2849/2849-h/2849-h.htm|title=Against Apion by Flavius Josephus, Book II, Chapter 17|work=gutenberg.org|date=October 2001}}</ref>

Josephus' definition was widely accepted until the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, when the term took on negative [[connotation]]s and was barely salvaged by [[Hegel]]'s commentary.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moked|first=Oran|date=2004|title=The Relationship between Religion and State in Hegel's Thought|journal=Hegel Bulletin|language=en|volume=25|issue=1–2|pages=96–112|doi=10.1017/S0263523200002032|issn=2051-5367|doi-access=free}}</ref> The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning "sacerdotal government under divine inspiration" (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning "priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power" was recorded in 1825.

==Definition==
{{tone|section|date=December 2016}}
The term ''theocracy'' derives from the [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|θεοκρατία}}, "rule of God", a term used by [[Josephus]] for the [[kingdoms of Israel and Judah]],<ref>English form the 17th century (''[[OED]]'').
The Greek term is explicitly coined by Josephus and isn't attested elsewhere in Ancient Greek; Josephus marks it as a [[Nonce word|nonce]] coinage by calling it a "strained expression".
W. Whiston tr. [[Josephus]], ''Against Apion'' ii. §17 (1814) IV. 340: "He [Moses] ordained our government to be what, by a strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy", translating  {{lang|grc|ὡς δ'ἄν τίς εἴποι, βιασάμενος τὸν λόγον, θεοκρατίαν}}
</ref> reflecting the view that "God himself is recognized as the head" of the state.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] "A form of civil government in which God himself is recognized as the head."</ref>
The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ecclesiocracy.<ref>Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/bth ''Biblical Theocracy: A vision of the biblical foundations for a Christian political philosophy''] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1993), introduced these more precise uses of the terms in arguing that theocracy (in this pure sense) is the only political system defended in the Bible. While Palmquist defends theocracy in this pure form as a viable (though "non-political") political system, he warns that what normally goes by this name is actually ecclesiocracy, the most dangerous of all political systems.</ref>

In a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the deity or deities of that civilization's religion or belief, such as [[Muhammad]]'s leadership of the early Muslims with prophecies from [[God in Islam|Allah]]. In an ecclesiocracy, the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation. 

A related phenomenon is a secular government co-existing with a state religion or delegating some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in Israel, [[Marriage in Israel|marriage]] is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion) exists, nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.

# transclusion


> In computer science, transclusion is the inclusion of part or all of an electronic document into one or more other documents by hypertext reference. Transclusion is usually performed when the referencing document is displayed, and is normally automatic and transparent to the end user. The result of transclusion is a single integrated document made of parts assembled dynamically from separate sources, possibly stored on different computers in disparate places.

> Transclusion facilitates modular design: a resource  is stored once and distributed for reuse in multiple documents. Updates or corrections to a resource are then reflected in any referencing documents. Ted Nelson coined the term for his 1980 nonlinear book Literary Machines, but the idea of master copy and occurrences was applied 17 years before, in Sketchpad.

<u>Adjective</u>

*(Of an individual, project, social dynamic, single event, etc.)*

**Less present in popular discourse than is contextually appropriate.**

## dinkus


> In typography, a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks in a horizontal row, i.e.   ∗ ∗ ∗  . The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.

## undercovered

<u>Adjective</u>

*(Of an individual, project, social dynamic, single event, etc.)*

**Less present in popular discourse than is contextually appropriate.**

When I use the term "undercovered," I am describing something which "mainstream media" (*technology journalism*, most often) has not, is not, and/or is not likely to adequately amplify according to my own framework of relevance.

##### Some prime examples:

* [**Bandcamp as the answer to all contemporary woes regarding music streaming services**](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music).
* [Mastodon as the answer to (a great many) contemporary woes regarding social networks](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview).
* [Discord as a superior (and free!) Slack alternative for small businesses/projects](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison).

## dinkus


> In typography, a dinkus is a typographic symbol which often consists of three spaced asterisks in a horizontal row, i.e.   ∗ ∗ ∗  . The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical "break" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.

## undercovered

<u>Adjective</u>

*(Of an individual, project, social dynamic, single event, etc.)*

**Less present in popular discourse than is contextually appropriate.**

When I use the term "undercovered," I am describing something which "mainstream media" (*technology journalism*, most often) has not, is not, and/or is not likely to adequately amplify according to my own framework of relevance.

##### Some prime examples:

* [**Bandcamp as the answer to all contemporary woes regarding music streaming services**](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music).
* [Mastodon as the answer to (a great many) contemporary woes regarding social networks](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview).
* [Discord as a superior (and free!) Slack alternative for small businesses/projects](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison).
